I am a first-year MSCS student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Previously, I graduated from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in 2024, majoring in Computer Science. Previously, I worked as a research intern on the topic of LLM hallucination and alignment, advised by Professor [Tong Zhang](http://tongzhang-ml.org/). In 2023 Summer, I had the privilege to work as a research intern at [Blender Lab](https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/), advised by Professor [Heng Ji](https://blender.cs.illinois.edu/hengji.html).



Research Interest
------
My research interests include Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs). I have a broad interest in LLM alignment. I am now working on Reward Modeling for Mathematical Reasoning. I also worked on LLM hallucination in the past.
